# Spring Boot Deployment Practice

Cloud version can be found here: https://barkwirematt.herokuapp.com/api/dogs

Deploy the included working Spring Boot app to a cloud provider. Some things to note:

* The app will need a database to attach to
* The app needs to use environment variables but currently does not
* The app is based on Java 11

If it works, it will respond to requests at `api/dogs` without erroring.
